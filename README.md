## About Me

I am a seasoned Front End Developer with over 14 years of experience. Before my coding life, I was an artist, which gives me a unique perspective on design and details. I strive to create perfect websites with beautiful UIs and smooth UX.

My journey spans from the early days of table-based layouts to modern CSS Grid, and from jQuery to React and Vue. I am passionate about learning new technologies and applying my artistic background to front-end development.
